SpecialGames
============
Some simple javascript/html games for my son, Benjamin, who is autistic
and has learning difficulties.
He seems quite interested in mobile electronic devices (nintendo DS, 
my phone etc.) at the moment, so I want something that will run on
a cheap tablet computer for him.
The idea is that they will be colourful and move and make sounds.
They should be configurable so if someone else likes the idea, but
not the colour scheme etc. then they can change it easily.

What is (or at least will be) included
======================================

Photo Viewer - simple slideshow
Shapes - continually draws colurful shapes on the screen, with music.
