This is a modified version of the Snake demo provided with the android SDK under the Apache licence (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The changes are:
 - screen wraps around at the edges rather then ending game if a border is touched.
 - responds to screen tap events to change direction.
