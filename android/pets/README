PetsApp README
==============

This application is intended to be a very simple 3d animation of some pets
that our Son, Benjamin likes (dogs and ducks probably).

It is in a very early state of development.
The idea is that we will make the 3d models of the animals using blender
and export them as .OBJ files.
The application will read the .OBJ files and animate them.

This code is based on http://objloaderforand.sourceforge.net/.
